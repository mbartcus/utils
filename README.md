# utils

Here is some code that may be useful to me in the future. 
This repository will contain all the code that is common to all of my projects.

- ```utils``` folder contains our common project modules:
    1. custom_logger.py : set up our custom logger

- ```tests``` folder contains our unit tests for our created modules within ```utils```
